## Blackjack
My version of the well-known card game, although without any chips to bet with, and you can just play against the computer. I started this project as a fun learning exercise, to brush up on my JavaScript.

You may notice the lack of any 3rd party framework or module; modern browsers are a lot more compliant to web standards, and I'm not a fan of using Bundling tools through NodeJS.
